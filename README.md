1. Make the following changes to the HTML file:
- format the HTML (so that maintainers can easily read the HTML)
- replace the ??? placeholders with proper arguments
- NOTE: do not make other changes to code or naming (e.g., do not change the file extension)

2. Based on the changes above, create a PHP page to process the form data
- display each of the input values with proper labels next to each
- for example: Thy favorite color is: ochre

3. Change your index.php to make it easy for end-users and testers (and graders!)

4. To prepare for the first exam (9/13), add another form to your PHP result page.  Below the data displayed from the first form, create another form to prompt for more information.  Process the new data in a new PHP page.  Can you access the data from the first page?  How?
